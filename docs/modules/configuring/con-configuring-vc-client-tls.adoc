= Securing connections from clients

[role="_abstract"]
To secure client connections to virtual clusters, configure TLS on the virtual cluster by doing the following:

* Obtain a server certificate for the virtual cluster from a Certificate Authority (CA). +
Ensure the certificate matches the names of the virtual cluster's bootstrap and broker addresses. +
This may require wildcard certificates and Subject Alternative Names (SANs).

* Provide the TLS configuration using the `tls` properties in the virtual cluster's configuration to enable it to present the certificate to clients. 
Depending on your certificate format, apply one of the following examples.

* For mutual TLS, you may also use the `trust` properties to configure the virtual cluster to use TLS client authentication.

NOTE: TLS is recommended on Kafka clients and virtual clusters for production configurations.

<1> PKCS #12 store containing the private-key and certificate/intermediates of the virtual cluster.
<2> Password to protect the PKCS #12 store.
<3> (Optional) Password for the key. If a password is not specified, the keystoreâ€™s password is used to decrypt the key too.
<4> (Optional) Keystore type. If a keystore type is not specified, the default JKS (Java Keystore) type is used.

<1> Private key of the virtual cluster.
<2> Public certificate of the virtual cluster.
<3> (Optional) Password for the key.

You can configure the virtual cluster to require that clients present a certificate for authentication. 
The virtual cluster verifies that the client's certificate is signed by one of the CA certificates contained in a trust store.  
If verification fails, the client's connection is refused.

.Example to configure TLS client authentication using PKCS12 trust store
[source,yaml]
----
# ... (filterDefinitions, defaultFilters etc)
virtualClusters:
  demo:
    # ... (targetCluster, clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider etc)
    tls:
      key:
        # ...
      trust:
        storeFile: <path>/trust.p12 #1 <1>
        storePassword:
          passwordFile: <path>/trust.password # <2>
        storeType: PKCS12 # <3>
        trustOptions:
          clientAuth: REQUIRED # <4>
# ...
----
<1> PKCS #12 store containing CA certificate(s) used to verify that the client's certificate is trusted.
<2> (Optional) Password to protect the PKCS #12 store.
<3> (Optional) Keystore type. If a keystore type is not specified, the default JKS (Java Keystore) type is used.
<4> Client authentication mode. 
If set to `REQUIRED`, the client must present a valid certificate. 
If set to `REQUESTED`, the client is requested to present a certificate. If presented, the certificate is validated. If the client chooses not to present a certificate the connection is still allowed. 
If set to `NONE`, client authentication is disabled.

NOTE: The client's identity, as established through TLS client authentication, is currently not relayed to the target cluster.
