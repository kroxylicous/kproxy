= Defining filters

There is flexibility in how to configure filters. Consider the following example:

[id='con-filterDefinitions-defaultFilters-{context}']
.`filterDefinitions`, `defaultFilters` and a virtual cluster's `filters` work together
[source,yaml]
----
filterDefinitions:
  - name: encryption
    type: RecordEncryption
    config:
      # ... (configuration for RecordEncryption)
  - name: validation
    type: RecordValidation
    config:
      # ... (configuration for RecordValidation)
  - name: special-encryption
    type: RecordEncryption
    config:
      # ... (configuration for RecordEncryption)
defaultFilters:
  - validation
  - encryption
virtualClusters:
  my-proxy-with-default-filters:
    # ... (configuration for this virtual cluster)
  my-proxy-with-custom-filters:
    filters:
      - validation
      - special-encryption
    # ... (configuration for this virtual cluster)
# ... (virtualClusters, etc.)
----

* The order of definitions in `filterDefinitions` does not matter.
* Each filter definition in `filterDefinitions` must have a unique `name`, but you can have multiple definitions with the same type and different configurations (as with `encryption` and `special-encryption` in the above example).
* The order of `defaultFilters` is the order in which the filters be applied to an incoming client request. In the above example we will validate records, and then encrypt them.
* The `defaultFilters` will be used for all virtual clusters which don't define their own `filters`, such as `my-proxy-with-default-filters`
* The `defaultFilters` is optional. It useful to define filters when all your virtual clusters should use the same filters. There's no need to specify it if all your virtual clusters define their own filters.
* When a virtual cluster defines its own `filters`, like `my-proxy-with-custom-filters`, then those filters are used instead of the `defaultFilters`.
* When you use `defaultFilters`, or a virtual cluster's `filters` to refer to a filter definition, you must have defined a filter with that name in `filterDefinitions`

There is also a top level `filters` property, which accepts _anonymous_ filter definitions, without a `name`.

WARNING: `filters` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Kroxylicious. It is recommended to update existing configurations to use `filterDefinitions` instead.

[id='con-filters-{context}']
.The deprecated `filters` property
[source,yaml]
----
filters: # deprecated!
  - type: RecordEncryption
    config:
      # ...
virtualClusters:
  my-proxy-with-default-filters:
    # ...
----

When the top level `filters` property is used it will be applied for all the virtual clusters.
It is not allowed to specify both the top level `filters` and `filterDefinitions` properties in the same configuration.
